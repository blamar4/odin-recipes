        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Making scrambled eggs with cherry tomatoes may not seem like a common practice, since having a pool of liquid under your eggs is considered bad form. But I don’t care, because I have toast! Cooking isn’t always about doing the right thing, and this summer scramble is a perfect example. Try to find a goat milk feta cheese for this — it’s awesome!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
                <li>9 cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons crumbled feta cheese</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 pinch sea salt</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk eggs and pepper flakes together in a bowl. Stir in tomatoes, feta, and basil.</li>
                <li>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over high heat until starting to shimmer. Pour egg mixture into hot oil and cook, without stirring, for 5 seconds.</li>
                <li>Cook and stir egg mixture until eggs are scrambled and softly set, about 30 seconds. Transfer to a plate and sprinkle with sea salt.</li>
            </ol>
